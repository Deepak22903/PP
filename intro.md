My name is Deepak Shitoye, and I am a final-year Computer Engineering student at COEP Technological University.

My approach to software development is deeply rooted in understanding my tools at a fundamental level. This drives my passion for working in Linux environments and meticulously customizing development workflows for maximum efficiency.

My project experience is diverse, spanning from developing machine learning models for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions to making open-source contributions which have been featured in official repos, leveraging third-party APIs to build real-world applications, and creating a multilingual AI banking assistant. All these have led to winning numerous hackathons and competitions.

I'm especially excited to be interviewing with Citi today because I was actually a Finalist at the Citi India Hackathon last month. My team developed an AI-powered recruitment ecosystem, and that project gave me a real passion for tackling complex challenges in the FinTech space.

This passion for technology also extends to community building. As the Technical Coordinator for the Computer Society of India, I have successfully organized numerous hackathons and technical sessions for my peers.

I am eager to bring this blend of direct FinTech experience and technical skill to your team. I am confident that my dedication to creating efficient, well-structured solutions would make me a valuable contributor.
